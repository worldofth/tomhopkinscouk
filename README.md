know i want dark background
want some sort of progress bar thing for skills
	might want to think if there is a commong shape i can use to denote the out of 5

want to have a list of words that relate to each skill names
want these to look secondary and not pronouced, might flash them up during intial page view to let people know they exist

## portfolio
white background to show distinct change from previous section
grid of websites i've built
think small blurb per site with some thoughts
