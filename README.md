For the design i drew inspiration from:
- [Nier:Automata Options UI](https://www.pcinvasion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/NieR-Automata-visuals-1.jpg)
- [Elementalist Lux Skin Overview](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/elementalist-lux)
- [Nekomonogatari Opening animation](https://vimeo.com/109421461)

With this design i was able to play around with different techniques i don't touch very often, like for instance text shadow, Rotated text, background textures, decorative elements to draw the eye and new tech like grid and object fit.
